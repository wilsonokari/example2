most programmers use a readme.txt file to explain what the project is about.....
it can be as simple as a few lines or paragraphs to a very long complex file..!

this is the new added line.
for this change to be reflected in the github repository we still need to do a git add, git commit and git push...

updated!!

you have updated readme file in branch task..now we need to get the changes in 
master too, what do we do?
we pull from branch task while we at master
